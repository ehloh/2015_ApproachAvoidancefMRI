THIS version of the models: 
Parameters are not NOT linked between the cF and ct conditions.




——

 

Since parameters i and e are trading off, we now define i so that, if e is in the model already, i is only a residual of e. 

For models that do not have e, i is left as previous (i.e. just a scalar bonus to posterior VAcc). 

w is allowed to vary freely
