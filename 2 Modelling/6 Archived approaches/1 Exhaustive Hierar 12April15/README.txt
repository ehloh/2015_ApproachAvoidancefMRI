12/4/15: Decided to execute the model fit in a way that links parameters that apply across both tasks. This folder holds all the materials from a thorough modelrun (fixed and hierarchical) where the parameters were NOT linked across the two conditions. 


This approach:

- cF and ct not linked
- v variable may be wrong in the dataset (immaterial, since this model does very poorly in general)
- w was allowed to be +/-
- i was a residual of e, where applicable. 




16/4: RETURNED to this approach. Value functions from here were returned to the main folder


NOTE: All hierarfit results in this folder have not been checked for mismatches between r_res, r_iterd and r_iterations. These must be checked if you want to resample the BICs
